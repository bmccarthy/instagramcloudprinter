# instagram cloud printer

This is something I created to be able to print photos from instagram to any google cloud connected printer.

The idea came up because I am getting married shortly and thought it would be cool to have guests Instagram tagged photos print automatically.  I also wanted to open source a useful project and thought this was a good chance.

For the project, I bought a SELPHY CP800 printer, a Raspberry Pi 2 B, and battery supplies for both since the wedding is outside and may not have power outlets available. Also, I bought a bluetooth adapter for the Pi so it could tether to my cell phone for internet access.

rethinkdb - http://rethinkdb.com/- I used the catsofinstagram sample from rethinkdb as a starting point in integrating with the Instagram API to get a stream of new photos with subscribed to tags

mobile angular ui - http://mobileangularui.com/ - I used Mobile Angular UI to create the mobile focused website.
